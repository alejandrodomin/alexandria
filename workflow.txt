1. lexical analysis that tokenizes the code
2. parser analysis that turns said tokens into an action tree
3. semantic analysis that looks for errors in the code
4. assembly / IR generation
5. binary file generation using an assembler or custom
6. linker to create final executable



I will redo the scope to only handle basic arithmatic, in the hopes of building an MVP as quickly as possible
example:
	a = 5
	b = 2
	c = a + b
	print c
